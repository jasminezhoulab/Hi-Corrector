# Hi-Corrector
Hi-Corrector is a fast, scalable and memory-efficient software package to remove biases from chromatin contact matrices generated by genome-wide proximity ligation assays, e.g. Hi-C and its variant TCC. The sequential version is implemented in ANSI C and can be easily compiled on any system; the parallel version is implemented in ANSI C with the MPI library (a standardized and portable parallel environment designed for solving large-scale scientific problems).
